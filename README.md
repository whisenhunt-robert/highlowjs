# Overview

I once made a Higher or Lower game using the Java language. I wanted to see if I could make that same game in HTML using JavaScript. In Java, my game requires the player to type "h" for higher or "l" for lower. Thanks to JavaScript's button features, the player just has to simply click the Higher or Lower buttons to declare if they think their number is Higher or Lower than the CPU's number.

The purpose for writing this software was to test my knowledge of what I've learned so far in the JavaScript language. I have found that I really enjoy HTML and CSS, and I knew JavaScript is the third language that goes together with them. Once one masters all three, you never know what you can make!
